## [1.0.0]
### Initial

- Implemented a script that accepts a filename as a command-line argument and prints the number of lines in the file.
- The original task simply required printing the line count or saying "No file provided."
- I chose to expand the functionality by:
  - Adding clear, color-coded feedback (e.g., red for errors, green for success).
  - Handling the case where the file doesn't exist.
  - Using inline comments to document what each section does.
- These additions make the script more user-friendly, informative, and maintainable â€” especially useful in real-world scripting scenarios.
