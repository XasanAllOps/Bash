# Changelog

All notable changes to this script will be documented in this file 🙌🏽

## [1.0.0] 
### Initial
- A challenge which requires creating a script to move an existing file `knight.txt` from one directory (`Batllefield`) to a new directory (`Newhome`) and displays the contents of both directories.
- Will seek to make it more dynamic and complex 😎
