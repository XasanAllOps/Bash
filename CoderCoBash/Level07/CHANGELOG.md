# Changelog

All notable changes to this script will be documented in this file üôåüèΩ

## [1.0.0]
### Initial

- Wrote a script that prompts the user to input a directory name, then lists all `.txt` files within that directory sorted from smallest to largest by file size.
- Enhanced the original challenge by:
  - Adding color-coded output for better visual feedback.
  - Including input validation to check if the directory exists or if no input is given.
  - Improving readability of the output with clearer formatting and messages.
  - Filtering specifically for `.txt` files instead of all files, which adds useful specificity.
- Also added inline comments throughout the script to explain key commands (e.g., `sort`, `awk`, `ls -lh`) for better clarity and maintainability.
- This version provides a more user-friendly, focused, and visually polished experience compared to the original task.
